Hi there! I’m Robin, based in the city of Geneva, Switzerland. I work as a Lead Business Insights Analyst at Caterpillar Inc., where I leverage over 20 years of experience in building websites, analyzing data, and playing with SQL to support the aftermarket sales growth.

Recently, I’ve embarked on an exciting journey into the world of AI to expand my scope and explore new possibilities. This GitHub repository is a reflection of my passion for technology and continuous learning.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!
